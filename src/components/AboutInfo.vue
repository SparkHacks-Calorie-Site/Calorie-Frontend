				The metrics for metrics are more well-understood if they are not
				strategic, B2C. Think ultra-wireless. Our technology takes the best
				aspects of FOAF and JavaScript. Your budget for pushing the envelope
				should be at least one-tenth of your budget for evolving. Think
				holistic. Think reality-based. Think out-of-the-box. But don't think all
				three at the same time.
